Try to find the function equation Γ(X), which Γ(X+1) = XΓ(X), Γ(1)=1 (1!,2!,3!,4!...n!)





                +ꝏ 
Note that ζ(s) = ∑    1/n^s (Re(s)>0) Prove: Except for negative integer real numbers,                 x=1                                   all zero points of ζ(s) have real parts 1/2.
